# Sudoku Solver

## This is a work in progress.

For now the onlay thing a program does is: displays a winow with partially filled sudoku board, has a solve button that initiates primitive backtracking algorithm that solves a puzzle. The goal is to do this in real time (with a slowed down algorithm) pauses that you can regulate those pauses.
